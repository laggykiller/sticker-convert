```

If you are running python script directly, run with `src/sticker-convert.py`

If you installed by pip, run with `sticker-convert` or `python -m sticker_convert`

If you are running macOS, run with `sticker-convert.app/Contents/MacOS/sticker-convert-cli`

Examples:

Only download from a source

`sticker-convert --download-signal <url> --no-compress`

Convert local files to signal compatible stickers

`sticker-convert --input-dir ./custom-input --output-dir ./custom-output --preset signal`

`sticker-convert --preset signal`

Convert signal to telegram stickers and upload to telegram

`sticker-convert --download-signal <url> --export-telegram --telegram-token <your_bot_token_here> --telegram-userid <your_userid_here> --save-cred`

Convert local files to multiple formats and export

`sticker-convert --export-telegram --export-signal`

Convert local files to a custom format

`sticker-convert --fps-min 3 --fps-max 30 --quality-min 30 --quality-max 90 --res-min 512 --res-max 512 --steps 10 --vid-size-max 500000 --img-size-max 500000 --vid-format .apng --img-format .png`

Tip: Use the CLI for converting multiple stickers all at once without intervention!

The following example converts two Line sticker packs into Signal, Telegram and WhatsApp all at once
```
sticker-convert --no-confirm --download-auto https://store.line.me/stickershop/product/1/en --export-signal
sticker-convert --no-confirm --export-telegram
sticker-convert --no-confirm --export-whatsapp

sticker-convert --no-confirm --download-line https://store.line.me/stickershop/product/2/en --preset signal --export-signal
sticker-convert --no-confirm --preset telegram --export-telegram
sticker-convert --no-confirm --preset whatsapp --export-whatsapp
```

Note that you can see the conversion result in export-result.txt

## FAQ

### Platform-specific guides (e.g. Getting credentials)
- [Signal](docs/guide_signal.md)
- [Telegram](docs/guide_telegram.md)
- [WhatsApp](docs/guide_whatsapp.md)
- [Line](docs/guide_line.md)
- [Kakao](docs/guide_kakao.md)
- [Viber](docs/guide_viber.md)
- [Discord](docs/guide_discord.md)
- [iMessage](docs/guide_imessage.md)

### Conversion is slow
Try the following tips:
- Increase number of processes (`--processes`)
    - Increasing over default value can actually be slower though
- Decrease number of steps (`--steps`)
    - Decreasing too much can result in poor quality though

### Running out of RAM / System frozen
Try to decrease number of processes (`--processes`)

### MacOS complains that program from unidentified developer
To become an identified developer, I have to pay USD$99 to Apple every year.

There are two ways to bypass this problem:
1. Permanent: Open terminal and execute `sudo spctl --master-disable` before running `sticker-convert`.
2. Temporary: Open terminal and execute `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine ./Downloads/sticker-convert-macos.zip` before extracting the downloaded zip file.

If macOS still complains about individual binaries (e.g. apngasm), go to `System Preferences > Security & Privacy` and press `Open Anyway` for each file.

To learn more, read this page: https://disable-gatekeeper.github.io/

### I want to upload stickers that are in stickers_output that have not been uploaded yet
CLI: Run with `--no-compress --export-xxxxx`

GUI: Select `From local directory` for Input source, tick `No compression` box and select `Upload to xxxxx` for Output options

### Where are credentials stored?
Credentials are stored in creds.json

By default, it should be in the same directory you run the program.

However, if the directory is not writable (e.g. Installed it to `/Applications` in macOS, or `/usr/local/bin` in Linux), then `creds.json` is stored in...
- Windows: `%APPDATA%/sticker-convert/creds.json`
- Other: `~/.config/sticker-convert/creds.json`

### What does "power" and "steps" mean?
It's actually a bisection method to look for most optimal compression setting. The `power` provides a way to make the values 'deviate' to one side (Negative power would cause sticker-convert to try more large values; Power set to 1 would cause sticker-convert to distribute it's trial evenly between the min and max values; Power more than 1 would cause sticker-convert to try more small values)

To illustrate, let's look at what `--steps 16 --fps-min 5 --fps-max 30 --fps-power 3.0` does.
1. We would start from `8/16` (step 8 out of 16 steps), which is the mid-point.
2. We would calculate a factor using power: `(8/16)^3.0 = 0.125`
3. The fps setting is `round((max - min) * step / steps * factor + min)`, which is `round((16-1) * 8 / 16 * 0.125 + 5) = round(5.9375) = 6`. This means fps would be set to 6.
4. If the file size is too small, then we would try `4/16` (step 4 out of 16 steps, which is midpoint of 0 to 8.). Else, we would try `10/16` (step 10 out of 16 steps, which is midpoint of 8 to 16).
5. Repeat 1-3.
